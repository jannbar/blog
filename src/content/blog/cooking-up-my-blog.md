At last! A personal blog as a place to collect all the random stuff that I need at irregular intervals and always think to myself "I should write this down somewhere!"

I will use this blog mostly as a reference book for myself. If some of you can profit from this as well, that's great!

Getting to the point â€“ this is how I cooked my blog:

## Ingredients

- [Astro](https://astro.build), using their [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) feature
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- Deployed at [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Visual Electric](https://visualelectric.com/), an AI powered image generation service

## Design

The colors are from Steph Ango's beautiful [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki) color scheme. The layout is heavily inspired by [Ben Borgers'](https://ben.page) wonderful page.
