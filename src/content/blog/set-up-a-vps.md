CJ from [Syntax](https://syntax.fm) just posted a great tutorial on how to configure a VPS from scratch on YouTube. He covers all the basics, such as securing the SSH login and firewalls, and also explains how to set up [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) to serve applications.

I got the cheapest VPS from [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com) and am looking forward to play around with it!
